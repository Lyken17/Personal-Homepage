# Biography

 I was a visiting student of [Prof. Song Han](https://songhan.mit.edu/)'s group at MIT and will soon join [Intel](http://intel.com). Before coming to Boston, I have lived in beautiful Vancouver and Hangzhou, where I am a member of Dual Degree Program between Zhejiang University and Simon Fraser University. 
 
 My research interests mainly focus on machine learning and computer vision. Now I am working with [Prof. Song Han](https://songhan.mit.edu/) on effcient machine learning. Prior to this, I have worked with [Prof. Brian Funt](http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~funt/) on colour vision, and [Prof. Ping Tan](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~pingtan/) on attribute recognition and 3d visions.

<!-- Currently I am applying for Ph.D,  and also actively looking for internship position for 2019. If you are looking for someone who is familiar with deep learning, good at programming and has solid math backgrounds, I think I should be a good candidate. Have look at my [resume](Resume_Ligeng_Zhu_EN.pdf) ? -->
